Dataset Sescription:

1. **Income:** The income of the residents in the area where the house is located. This could be an important indicator of the neighborhood's socioeconomic status, which can influence house prices.

2. **House Age:** The age of the house, indicating how many years it has been since the house was constructed.

3. **No. of Rooms:** The total number of rooms in the house, which includes living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, etc.

4. **No. of Bedrooms:** The count of bedrooms in the house. This is a crucial factor in determining the size and capacity of the house.

5. **Area Population:** The population of the area or neighborhood where the house is situated. Population density can impact house prices.

6. **Price:** The target variable, representing the price of the house. This is what the machine learning model aims to predict based on the other columns.

7. **State:** The state where the property is located. This categorical variable could indicate regional variations in house prices due to factors such as local economies, real estate markets, and regulations.

These columns provide a concise set of features that can be used to predict house prices. The goal would be to develop a machine learning model that can learn the relationships between these features and the price of a house. By training the model on historical data, it can make predictions for new instances, helping potential buyers and sellers estimate house prices based on the provided information.
