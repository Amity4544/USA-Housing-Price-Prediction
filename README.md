**Project Title:  USA House Price Prediction using ML Regression**

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning regression model to predict the prices of houses in the United States. The dataset includes several key features such as average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms, area population, and the target variable, 'Price'. Additionally, the 'Address' field provides contextual information about the location of each house.

**Approach:**
The project will start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and detect outliers. Data preprocessing steps will involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

Regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting will be explored to predict house prices. Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation will be conducted to optimize the model's performance.

**Evaluation:**
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared to assess how well the model predicts house prices. Cross-validation may also be employed to ensure robustness.
